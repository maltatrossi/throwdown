/*
1. The client connects to the server via a WebSocket or socket.io connection.
2. The server uses Express to handle HTTP requests and socket.io to handle WebSocket connections between the clients and the server.
3. The server implements authentication using Passport.js and a MongoDB database to store user data securely.
4. When a new player connects to the server, the server adds them to the lobby system.
5. Once enough players have joined the game, the server initializes the game, sets up the game board, and ensures that all players are connected and ready to play.
6. The server starts the game by randomly assigning each player a set of dice, setting a maximum number of rounds, and starting the first round.
7. For each round, the server gives each player a chance to roll their dice, waits for all players to finish rolling before revealing any dice, displays the results of each player's roll, and updates the game board accordingly.
8. Once the maximum number of rounds is reached, the server determines the winner based on the highest score and updates player statistics and high scores in the database.
9. The server allows players to play again or quit the game, and implements the game restart logic to start a new game when the current one is over.
10. The server uses the Wallet class in wallet.js to allow players to manage their in-game currency, with the data stored in a MongoDB database.
11. The server sets up a MongoDB database to store player progress and high scores.
